# TransparentMSKeyboard
A software that set the transparency of Windows 10's (Onscreen) Touchscreen Keyboard (or so called "Microsoft Text Input Application")

How to?
Simply run the executable (.exe) in the ..\bin\debug\ folder and it will immediately reduce the Opacity of the Keyboard to half,
  just make sure the Keyboard is displayed on-screen first. The effect will last the whole Window 10 session.

To fine tuning the Opacity just make a Window Shortcut to the executable:
eg: ..\bin\debug\MSTouchKeyboardTransparent.exe
and add Opacity value from 1 to 255 (with 255 as max value):
eg: ..\bin\debug\MSTouchKeyboardTransparent.exe 200
